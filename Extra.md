# Extra assignments

*... for hackers, independent solving for when you get bored.*

1. Transform the login form into a [modal dialog](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals).
Put a login link to the header menu, clicking on the link opens the login dialog. Should work [like this](http://www.alessioatzeni.com/wp-content/tutorials/jquery/login-box-modal-dialog-window/index.html).

2. Add a background image to the template. See [here](http://subtlepatterns.com/) for inspiration.

3. Use [I18n](http://kohanaframework.org/3.3/guide/kohana/files/i18n) to translate text strings. Your HTML / controller should only contain placeholder strings (read Kohana manual on I18n), Estonian text files should be under APPPATH/i18n/et.php.
4. Use the [Menu](https://github.com/anroots/kohana-menu) module to build and display the main menu bar (black one at the top of the screen). Your menu should be described in a configuration file from now on, not in HTML. Read module documentation.
5. Do your work on a development branch (create, checkout and push a new branch called *develop*). See [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6210272/how-does-a-git-repository-works-with-a-develop-and-master-branch).
6. [Refactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) existing code: make it pretty, readable and more efficient. See [here](http://refactoring.com/catalog/index.html).
